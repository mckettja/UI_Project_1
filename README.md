# User Interface I Project 1
## Smart Object: Smart Desk
## Project Summay and Documentation
The main goal of this project is to design a user interface for a 'smart object'. The general project timeline is as follows:
### 1. Brainstorm possible ideas for a smart object.
- This step is designed to give a wide variety of different user interfaces to choose from. This was done as a class. 
### 2. Choose a smart object from a dedicated list and gather design requirements for the project user interface.
- Our class list consisted of a smart desk, cookbook, bike, window, or mirror. For my personal project, I chose to design a UI for a ***'smart desk'***.
### 3. Prototype possible physical and digital designs. Document all information gathered during this phase.
- Step 1 was to gather design requirements through interviews. My interview summary is listed below:
**(interview notes)**
- Step 2 was to follow the ['10-plus-10' protocol](https://mweprin.medium.com/10x10-sketch-method-9c662656d67d) for exploring different physical designs of our smart object.
**(design sketches)**
- Here were my final sketches chosen for my physical and digital design.
**(final physical designs)**
**(final digital design)**
### 4. Program a working interface in React.js using components.
- Step 3 is to apply everything learned in step 1 and step 2 to implement a working application.
- Here is the color scheme I decided to follow for my application:
**(color scheme screenshot)**
- My thought process for this smart desk application was to have a screen integrated into the physical desk where the user can indicate if they are at their desk for **productivity** or **entertainment** purposes. Each page of the application was designed to assist the user with either of these activities.
- Here is the color pallette I chose for my application:

## How To Launch Application
### 1. Copy this repository.
### 2. Run the following commands in the terminal, from your desired code compiler.
- Cd into the smart-desk-ui directory with the following command:
```cmd
cd .\smart-desk-ui\
```
- Then run the following to host the react application locally:
```cmd
npm run dev
```
The output from the previous command should be as follows:
```cmd
> smart-desk-ui@0.0.0 dev
> vite


  VITE v4.4.9  ready in 630 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h to show help
```
### 3. Open the given local host ID into your browser.
- From the previously stated output, hold the 'ctrl' button on your keyboard and click the localhost ID.
- If your compiler does not support this feature, copy the localhost ID 'http://localhost:5173/' and paste it into your browser without the apostrophes.
